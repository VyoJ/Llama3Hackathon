SQL Auto Vector Query Engine - LlamaIndex


In this tutorial, we show you how to use our SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine.

This query engine allows you to combine insights from your structured tables with your unstructured data. It first decides whether to query your structured tables for insights. Once it does, it can then infer a corresponding query to the vector store in order to fetch corresponding documents.

**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only databases, sandboxing, etc.

\#          This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.
\#          This is normally not allowed, we use nest\_asyncio to allow it for convenience.

### Create Common Objects[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/query_engine/SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine/#create-common-objects)

This includes a `ServiceContext` object containing abstractions such as the LLM and chunk size. This also includes a `StorageContext` object containing our vector store abstractions.

Query Engine response: Berlin's history dates back to around 60,000 BC, with the earliest human traces found in the area. A Mesolithic deer antler mask found in Biesdorf (Berlin) was dated around 9000 BC. During Neolithic times, a large number of communities existed in the area and in the Bronze Age, up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC and Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.

The earliest evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte, and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and KÃ¶penick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. 

The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. CÃ¶lln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated. In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.

The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- ("swamp"). or Proto-Slavic bÑŒrlogÑŠ, (lair, den). Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word BÃ¤r ("bear"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms.
