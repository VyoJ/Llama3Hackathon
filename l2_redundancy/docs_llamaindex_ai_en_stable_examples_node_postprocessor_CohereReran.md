Final Response: Sam Altman was asked if he wanted to be the president
of Y Combinator. Initially, he declined as he wanted to start a
startup focused on making nuclear reactors. However, after persistent
persuasion, he eventually agreed to become the president of Y
Combinator starting with the winter 2014 batch.
