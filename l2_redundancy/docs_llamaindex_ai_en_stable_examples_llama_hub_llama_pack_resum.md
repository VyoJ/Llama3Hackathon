This example shows you how to use the Resume Screener Llama Pack. You can find all packs on [https://llamahub.ai](https://llamahub.ai/)

The resume screener is designed to analyze a candidate's resume according to a set of criteria, and decide whether the candidate is a fit for the job.

in this example we'll evaluate a sample resume (e.g. Jerry's old resume).

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

%pip install llama\-index\-readers\-wikipedia

%pip install llama-index-readers-wikipedia

### Setup Data[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llama_hub/llama_pack_resume/#setup-data)

We'll load some sample Wikipedia data for OpenAI, Sam, Mira, and Emmett. Why? No reason in particular :)

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

from llama\_index.readers.wikipedia import WikipediaReader

loader \= WikipediaReader()
documents \= loader.load\_data(
    pages\=\["OpenAI", "Sam Altman", "Mira Murati", "Emmett Shear"\],
    auto\_suggest\=False,
)

from llama\_index.readers.wikipedia import WikipediaReader loader = WikipediaReader() documents = loader.load\_data( pages=\["OpenAI", "Sam Altman", "Mira Murati", "Emmett Shear"\], auto\_suggest=False, )

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

\# do sentence splitting on the first piece of text
from llama\_index.core.node\_parser import SentenceSplitter

\# do sentence splitting on the first piece of text from llama\_index.core.node\_parser import SentenceSplitter

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

sentence\_splitter \= SentenceSplitter(chunk\_size\=1024)

sentence\_splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk\_size=1024)

We get the first chunk from each essay.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

openai\_node \= sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[0\]\])\[0\]
sama\_node \= sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[1\]\])\[0\]
mira\_node \= sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[2\]\])\[0\]
emmett\_node \= sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[3\]\])\[0\]

\# get the first 1024 tokens for each entity openai\_node = sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[0\]\])\[0\] sama\_node = sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[1\]\])\[0\] mira\_node = sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[2\]\])\[0\] emmett\_node = sentence\_splitter.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(\[documents\[3\]\])\[0\]

We'll also download Jerry's resume in 2019.
