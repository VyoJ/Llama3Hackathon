OnDemandLoaderTool Tutorial - LlamaIndex


Our `OnDemandLoaderTool` is a powerful agent tool that allows for "on-demand" data querying from any data source on LlamaHub.

This tool takes in a `BaseReader` data loader, and when called will 1) load data, 2) index data, and 3) query the data.

In this walkthrough, we show how to use the `OnDemandLoaderTool` to convert our Wikipedia data loader into an accessible search tool for a LangChain agent.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

from llama\_index.core.tools.ondemand\_loader\_tool import OnDemandLoaderTool from llama\_index.readers.wikipedia import WikipediaReader from typing import List from pydantic import BaseModel

### Define Tool[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/tools/OnDemandLoaderTool/#define-tool)

We first define the `WikipediaReader`. Note that the `load_data` interface to `WikipediaReader` takes in a list of `pages`. By default, this queries the Wikipedia search endpoint which will autosuggest the relevant pages.

We then wrap it into our `OnDemandLoaderTool`.

By default since we don't specify the `index_cls`, a simple vector store index is initialized.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

reader \= WikipediaReader()

reader = WikipediaReader()

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

tool \= OnDemandLoaderTool.from\_defaults(
    reader,
    name\="Wikipedia Tool",
    description\="A tool for loading and querying articles from Wikipedia",
)

tool = OnDemandLoaderTool.from\_defaults( reader, name="Wikipedia Tool", description="A tool for loading and querying articles from Wikipedia", )

#### Testing[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/tools/OnDemandLoaderTool/#testing)

We can try running the tool by itself (or as a LangChain tool), just to showcase what the interface is like!

Note that besides the arguments required for the data loader, the tool also takes in a `query_str` which will be the query against the index.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

\# run tool by itself
tool(\["Berlin"\], query\_str\="What's the arts and culture scene in Berlin?")

\# run tool by itself tool(\["Berlin"\], query\_str="What's the arts and culture scene in Berlin?")

Out\[Â \]:

"\\nBerlin has a vibrant and diverse arts and culture scene. It is home to 44 theaters and stages, three major opera houses, and numerous art galleries. The cityscape of Berlin displays large quantities of urban street art, and the Berlin Wall has become one of the largest open-air canvasses in the world. Berlin also has a long history of gay culture, and is an important birthplace of the LGBT rights movement. There are many festivals and events throughout the year, such as the Berlin International Film Festival, the Karneval der Kulturen, the Berlin Festival, and the New Year's Eve celebrations. The city is also home to many museums, such as the Museum Island, the GemÃ¤ldegalerie, the Neue Nationalgalerie, the Pergamon Museum, the Bode Museum, the Hamburger Bahnhof, the German Museum of Technology, the Jewish Museum, the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde, the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, the Museum Berggruen, and the Beate Uhse Erotic Museum."

\# run tool as langchain structured tool
lc\_tool \= tool.to\_langchain\_structured\_tool(verbose\=True)

\# run tool as langchain structured tool lc\_tool = tool.to\_langchain\_structured\_tool(verbose=True)

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

lc\_tool.run(
    tool\_input\={
        "pages": \["Berlin"\],
        "query\_str": "What's the arts and culture scene in Berlin?",
    }
)

lc\_tool.run( tool\_input={ "pages": \["Berlin"\], "query\_str": "What's the arts and culture scene in Berlin?", } )

### Initialize LangChain Agent[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/tools/OnDemandLoaderTool/#initialize-langchain-agent)

For tutorial purposes, the agent just has access to one tool - the Wikipedia Reader

Note that we need to use Structured Tools from LangChain.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent
from langchain.chat\_models import ChatOpenAI

from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent from langchain.chat\_models import ChatOpenAI

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

llm \= ChatOpenAI(temperature\=0, model\_name\="gpt-3.5-turbo", streaming\=True)

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model\_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", streaming=True)

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

agent \= initialize\_agent(
    \[lc\_tool\],
    llm\=llm,
    agent\="structured-chat-zero-shot-react-description",
    verbose\=True,
)

agent = initialize\_agent( \[lc\_tool\], llm=llm, agent="structured-chat-zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True, )

Now let's run some queries![Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/tools/OnDemandLoaderTool/#now-lets-run-some-queries)


The OnDemandLoaderTool allows the agent to simultaneously 1) load the data from Wikipedia, 2) query that data.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

agent.run("Tell me about the arts and culture of Berlin")

agent.run("Tell me about the arts and culture of Berlin")

Observation: 
The critical reception of The Departed was overwhelmingly positive. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% approval rating based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast, The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we have come to expect from Martin Scorsese." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "Aâˆ’" on an A+ to F scale. Entertainment Weekly ranked it on its end-of-the-decade "Best of" list, saying: "If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade (Taxi Driver in the '70s, Raging Bull in the '80s, Goodfellas in the '90s). His 2006 Irish Mafia masterpiece kept the streak alive." Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, praising Scorsese for thematically differentiating his film from the original. Online critic James Berardinelli awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it as "an American epic tragedy." He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese's past successes, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas.
