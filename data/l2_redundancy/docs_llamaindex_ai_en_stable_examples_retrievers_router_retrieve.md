Router Retriever - LlamaIndex


In this guide, we define a custom router retriever that selects one or more candidate retrievers in order to execute a given query.

The router (`BaseSelector`) module uses the LLM to dynamically make decisions on which underlying retrieval tools to use. This can be helpful to select one out of a diverse range of data sources. This can also be helpful to aggregate retrieval results across a variety of data sources (if a multi-selector module is used).

This notebook is very similar to the RouterQueryEngine notebook.

### Setup[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/router_retriever/#setup)

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

### Define Selector Module for Routing[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/router_retriever/#define-selector-module-for-routing)

There are several selectors available, each with some distinct attributes.

The LLM selectors use the LLM to output a JSON that is parsed, and the corresponding indexes are queried.

The Pydantic selectors (currently only supported by `gpt-4-0613` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` (the default)) use the OpenAI Function Call API to produce pydantic selection objects, rather than parsing raw JSON.

Here we use PydanticSingleSelector/PydanticMultiSelector but you can use the LLM-equivalents as well.
