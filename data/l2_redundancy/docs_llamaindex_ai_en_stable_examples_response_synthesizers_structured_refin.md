Refine with Structured Answer Filtering - LlamaIndex


When using our Refine response synthesizer for response synthesis, it's crucial to filter out non-answers. An issue often encountered is the propagation of a single unhelpful response like "I don't have the answer", which can persist throughout the synthesis process and lead to a final answer of the same nature. This can occur even when there are actual answers present in other, more relevant sections.

These unhelpful responses can be filtered out by setting `structured_answer_filtering` to `True`. It is set to `False` by default since this currently only works best if you are using an OpenAI model that supports function calling.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

### Failed Result[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/response_synthesizers/structured_refine/#failed-result)

As you can see, we weren't able to get the correct answer from the input `texts` strings since the initial "I don't know" answer propogated through till the end of the response synthesis.

### Successful Result[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/response_synthesizers/structured_refine/#successful-result)

As you can see, we were able to determine the correct answer from the given context by filtering the `texts` strings for the ones that actually contained the answer to our question.

Non Function-calling LLMs[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/response_synthesizers/structured_refine/#non-function-calling-llms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may want to make use of this filtering functionality with an LLM that doesn't offer a function calling API.

In that case, the `Refine` module will automatically switch to using a structured output `Program` that doesn't rely on an external function calling API.

### `CompactAndRefine`[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/response_synthesizers/structured_refine/#compactandrefine)

Since `CompactAndRefine` is built on top of `Refine`, this response mode also supports structured answer filtering.
