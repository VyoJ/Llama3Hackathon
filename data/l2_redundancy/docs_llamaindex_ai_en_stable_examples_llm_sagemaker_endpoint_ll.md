Interacting with LLM deployed in Amazon SageMaker Endpoint with LlamaIndex - LlamaIndex


An Amazon SageMaker endpoint is a fully managed resource that enables the deployment of machine learning models, specifically LLM (Large Language Models), for making predictions on new data.

This notebook demonstrates how to interact with LLM endpoints using `SageMakerLLM`, unlocking additional llamaIndex features. So, It is assumed that an LLM is deployed on a SageMaker endpoint.

Setting Up[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/sagemaker_endpoint_llm/#setting-up)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If youâ€™re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

%pip install llama\-index\-llms\-sagemaker\-endpoint

%pip install llama-index-llms-sagemaker-endpoint

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

! pip install llama\-index

! pip install llama-index

You have to specify the endpoint name to interact with.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

ENDPOINT\_NAME \= "<-YOUR-ENDPOINT-NAME->"

ENDPOINT\_NAME = "<-YOUR-ENDPOINT-NAME->"

Credentials should be provided to connect to the endpoint. You can either:

*   use an AWS profile by specifying the `profile_name` parameter, if not specified, the default credential profile will be used.
*   Pass credentials as parameters (`aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, `aws_session_token`, `region_name`).

66 years old (birthdate: September 4, 1951). He is a British-American computer scientist, programmer, and entrepreneur who is known for his work in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University and a researcher at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL).

Graham has made significant contributions to the field of computer science, including the development of the concept of "n-grams," which are sequences of n items that occur together in a dataset. He has also worked on the development of machine learning algorithms and has written extensively on the topic of machine learning.

Graham has received numerous awards for his work, including the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) A.M. Turing Award, the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award, and the IJCAI Award

Configure Model[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/sagemaker_endpoint_llm/#configure-model)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`SageMakerLLM` is an abstraction for interacting with different language models (LLM) deployed in Amazon SageMaker. All the default parameters are compatible with the Llama 2 model. Therefore, if you are using a different model, you will likely need to set the following parameters:

*   `messages_to_prompt`: A callable that accepts a list of `ChatMessage` objects and, if not specified in the message, a system prompt. It should return a string containing the messages in the endpoint LLM-compatible format.
    
*   `completion_to_prompt`: A callable that accepts a completion string with a system prompt and returns a string in the endpoint LLM-compatible format.
    
*   `content_handler`: A class that inherits from `llama_index.llms.sagemaker_llm_endpoint_utils.BaseIOHandler` and implements the following methods: `serialize_input`, `deserialize_output`, `deserialize_streaming_output`, and `remove_prefix`.
