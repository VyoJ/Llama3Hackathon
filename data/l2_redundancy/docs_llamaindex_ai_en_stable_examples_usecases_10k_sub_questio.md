\[lyft\_10k\] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Lyft
\[lyft\_10k\] Q: What geographies grew the fastest for Lyft
\[uber\_10k\] A: 
Uber experienced the fastest growth in five metropolitan areasâ€”Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. Additionally, Uber experienced growth in suburban and rural areas, though the network is smaller and less liquid in these areas.
\[lyft\_10k\] A: 
Lyft has seen the fastest growth in its ridesharing marketplace, Express Drive, Lyft Rentals, Light Vehicles, Public Transit, and Lyft Autonomous customer segments. These customer segments have seen increased demand due to the convenience and high-quality experience they offer drivers and riders, as well as the investments Lyft has made in its proprietary technology, M&A and strategic partnerships, and brand and marketing efforts.
\[lyft\_10k\] A: 
Lyft has grown rapidly in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. The ridesharing market grew rapidly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow after the pandemic. The market for Lyft's other offerings, such as its network of Light Vehicles, is also new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow.
\[uber\_10k\] A: in 2021?

The customer segments that grew the fastest for Uber in 2021 were Riders and Eaters, who use the platform for ridesharing services and meal preparation, grocery, and other delivery services, respectively. Additionally, Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass membership programs grew significantly in 2021, with over 6 million members.
