Guidance for Sub-Question Query Engine - LlamaIndex


In this notebook, we showcase how to use [**guidance**](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance) to improve the robustness of our sub-question query engine.

The sub-question query engine is designed to accept swappable question generators that implement the `BaseQuestionGenerator` interface.  
To leverage the power of [**guidance**](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance), we implemented a new `GuidanceQuestionGenerator` (powered by our `GuidancePydanticProgram`)

Guidance Question Generator[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/output_parsing/guidance_sub_question/#guidance-question-generator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike the default `LLMQuestionGenerator`, guidance guarantees that we will get the desired structured output, and eliminate output parsing errors.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

Generated 4 sub questions.
\[uber\_10k\] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Uber
\[uber\_10k\] A: in 2021?

The customer segments that grew the fastest for Uber in 2021 were its Mobility Drivers, Couriers, Riders, and Eaters. These segments experienced growth due to the continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as Uber's membership programs, such as Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass. Additionally, Uber's marketplace-centric advertising helped to connect merchants and brands with its platform network, further driving growth.
\[uber\_10k\] Q: What geographies grew the fastest for Uber
\[uber\_10k\] A: 
Based on the context information, it appears that Uber experienced the most growth in large metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, Miami, New York City, Sao Paulo, and London. Additionally, Uber experienced growth in suburban and rural areas, as well as in countries such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain.
\[lyft\_10k\] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Lyft
\[lyft\_10k\] A: 
The customer segments that grew the fastest for Lyft were ridesharing, light vehicles, and public transit. Ridesharing grew as Lyft was able to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. Light vehicles grew as users were looking for options that were more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. Public transit grew as Lyft integrated third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them.
\[lyft\_10k\] Q: What geographies grew the fastest for Lyft
\[lyft\_10k\] A: 
It is not possible to answer this question with the given context information.

It is not possible to answer the question of which geographies grew the fastest for Lyft with the given context information.

In summary, Uber and Lyft both experienced growth in customer segments related to their respective services, such as Mobility Drivers, Couriers, Riders, and Eaters for Uber, and ridesharing, light vehicles, and public transit for Lyft. Uber experienced the most growth in large metropolitan areas, as well as in suburban and rural areas, and in countries such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain. It is not possible to answer the question of which geographies grew the fastest for Lyft with the given context information.
