Auto-Retrieval from a Weaviate Vector Database - LlamaIndex


This guide shows how to perform **auto-retrieval** in LlamaIndex with [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).

The Weaviate vector database supports a set of [metadata filters](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/filters) in addition to a query string for semantic search. Given a natural language query, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to infer a set of metadata filters as well as the right query string to pass to the vector database (either can also be blank). This overall query bundle is then executed against the vector database.

This allows for more dynamic, expressive forms of retrieval beyond top-k semantic search. The relevant context for a given query may only require filtering on a metadata tag, or require a joint combination of filtering + semantic search within the filtered set, or just raw semantic search.

Setup[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/WeaviateIndex_auto_retriever/#setup)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We first define imports and define an empty Weaviate collection.

If you're opening this Notebook on Colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream\=sys.stdout))

import logging import sys logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO) logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))

We will be using GPT-4 for its reasoning capabilities to infer the metadata filters. Depending on your use case, `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` can work as well.

This Notebook uses Weaviate in [Embedded mode](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded), which is supported on Linux and macOS.

If you prefer to try out Weaviate's fully managed service, [Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/weaviate-cloud-services), you can enable the code in the comments.

Defining Some Sample Data[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/WeaviateIndex_auto_retriever/#defining-some-sample-data)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We insert some sample nodes containing text chunks into the vector database. Note that each `TextNode` not only contains the text, but also metadata e.g. `category` and `country`. These metadata fields will get converted/stored as such in the underlying vector db.

Build Vector Index with Weaviate Vector Store[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/WeaviateIndex_auto_retriever/#build-vector-index-with-weaviate-vector-store)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we load the data into the vector store. As mentioned above, both the text and metadata for each node will get converted into corresopnding representations in Weaviate. We can now run semantic queries and also metadata filtering on this data from Weaviate.

Define `VectorIndexAutoRetriever`[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/WeaviateIndex_auto_retriever/#define-vectorindexautoretriever)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We define our core `VectorIndexAutoRetriever` module. The module takes in `VectorStoreInfo`, which contains a structured description of the vector store collection and the metadata filters it supports. This information will then be used in the auto-retrieval prompt where the LLM infers metadata filters.

Running over some sample data[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/WeaviateIndex_auto_retriever/#running-over-some-sample-data)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We try running over some sample data. Note how metadata filters are inferred - this helps with more precise retrieval!
