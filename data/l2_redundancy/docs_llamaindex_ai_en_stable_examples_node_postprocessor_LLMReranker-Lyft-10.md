LLM Reranker Demonstration (2021 Lyft 10-k) - LlamaIndex


This tutorial showcases how to do a two-stage pass for retrieval. Use embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value in order to maximize recall and get a large set of candidate items. Then, use LLM-based retrieval to dynamically select the nodes that are actually relevant to the query.
