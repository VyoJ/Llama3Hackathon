 A hard moment for the author was when he realized that the AI programs of the time were not going
to be able to understand natural language and bridge the gap between what they could do and actually
understanding natural language. He had expected college to help him understand the ultimate truths,
but instead he found that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't
much left for these supposed ultimate truths. He also found himself in a situation where the
students and faculty had an arrangement that didn't require either to learn or teach anything, and
he was the only one painting the nude model. He was also painting still lives in his bedroom at
night on scraps of canvas due to his financial situation.
