DashScope Agent Tutorial - LlamaIndex


In this notebook tutorial, we will show you how to call the agent application built in the ModelStudio Platform. You can create an agent application in ModelStudio platform by referring to document: [Create application in ModelStudio.](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/2586405.html?spm=a2c4g.2400264.0.0.7c2e1ff58BeD83) If you open this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™ first and then install the following integration.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

%pip install llama\-index\-agent\-dashscope

%pip install llama-index-agent-dashscope

Note: Please note that you have to get <app\_id> and <api\_key> first and then initialize an agent. For how to get , please refer to guide: [How to get API-KEY in ModelStudio](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/2712195.html?spm=a2c4g.2400264.0.0.7c2e1ff5tp740E).

There are two ways you can set api-key when initializing a dashscope agent.

\# Set API key by environment variables
%env DASHSCOPE\_API\_KEY\=your\_api\_key

\# set API key by parameters
\# agent = DashScopeAgent(api\_key="your\_api\_key", app\_id="your\_app\_id")

\# Set API key by environment variables %env DASHSCOPE\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key # set API key by parameters # agent = DashScopeAgent(api\_key="your\_api\_key", app\_id="your\_app\_id")

Simple Chat[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/dashscope_agent/#simple-chat)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with a simple chat by using dashscope agent.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

from llama\_index.agent.dashscope import DashScopeAgent

agent \= DashScopeAgent(
    app\_id\="your\_app\_id",  \# The id of app that you created
    chat\_session\=True,  \# Enable chat session which will auto save and pass chat                               history to LLM.
    verbose\=False,  \# If need to print more details
)

resp \= agent.chat("I want to travel to Seattle.")
print(resp.response)

from llama\_index.agent.dashscope import DashScopeAgent agent = DashScopeAgent( app\_id="your\_app\_id", # The id of app that you created chat\_session=True, # Enable chat session which will auto save and pass chat history to LLM. verbose=False, # If need to print more details ) resp = agent.chat("I want to travel to Seattle.") print(resp.response)

Great choice! Seattle is a fantastic city known for its stunning natural beauty, vibrant culture, and technology scene. Here are some key points to consider when planning your trip to Seattle:

1. \*\*Best Time to Visit\*\*: The best time to visit Seattle is from June to September when the weather is at its warmest and driest. Keep in mind that Seattle is famous for its rain, so packing a waterproof jacket is always a good idea.

If you want to start with new conversation, you can reset and then call chat function.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

\# reset agent
agent.reset()

resp \= agent.chat("Are there any tourist attractions there?")
print(resp.response)

\# reset agent agent.reset() resp = agent.chat("Are there any tourist attractions there?") print(resp.response)

To provide a relevant answer, I would need to know which location you are referring to. Please specify the place you are interested in, and I can then share information about tourist attractions there.

Streaming Chat[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/dashscope_agent/#streaming-chat)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DashScope agent can also return response as a generator for chat, so you can stream every delta step.

for resp in response.chat\_stream:

Workspace[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/dashscope_agent/#workspace)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you have to pass workspace id when you created an agent application in non-default workspace. For how to use workspace, please refer to doc: [How to use different workspaces in ModelStudio.](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/2587495.html?spm=a2c4g.2712191.0.i29#c5222ec081sbo)

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

agent \= DashScopeAgent(
    app\_id\="your\_app\_id",  \# The id of app that you created
    chat\_session\=True,  \# Enable chat session which will auto save and pass chat                               history to LLM.
    workspace\="your\_workspace\_id",  \# Workspace id that the agent application belongs to.
    verbose\=False,  \# If need to print more details
)

resp \= agent.chat("The radius is 9.3 meters, what is the area of the circle?")
print(resp.response)

agent = DashScopeAgent( app\_id="your\_app\_id", # The id of app that you created chat\_session=True, # Enable chat session which will auto save and pass chat history to LLM. workspace="your\_workspace\_id", # Workspace id that the agent application belongs to. verbose=False, # If need to print more details ) resp = agent.chat("The radius is 9.3 meters, what is the area of the circle?") print(resp.response)

To find the area of a circle when you know the radius (r), you can use the formula:

\\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\\]

Given that the radius \\( r = 9.3 \\) meters, substituting this value into the formula gives:

\\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi (9.3)^2 \\\]
\\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 86.49 \\\]
\\\[ \\text{Area} \\approx 270.17 \\text{ square meters} \\\]

Therefore, the area of the circle with a radius of 9.3 meters is approximately 270.17 square meters.
