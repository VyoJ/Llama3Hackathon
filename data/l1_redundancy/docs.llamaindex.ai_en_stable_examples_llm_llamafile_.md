One of the simplest ways to run an LLM locally is using a [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile). llamafiles bundle model weights and a [specially-compiled](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#technical-details) version of [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) into a single file that can run on most computers any additional dependencies. They also come with an embedded inference server that provides an [API](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llama.cpp/server/README.md#api-endpoints) for interacting with your model.

Setup[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/llamafile/#setup)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Download a llamafile from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=llamafile)
2.  Make the file executable
3.  Run the file

Here's a simple bash script that shows all 3 setup steps:

\# Download a llamafile from HuggingFace
wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5\_K\_M.llamafile

\# Make the file executable. On Windows, instead just rename the file to end in ".exe".
chmod +x TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5\_K\_M.llamafile

\# Start the model server. Listens at http://localhost:8080 by default.
./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5\_K\_M.llamafile \--server \--nobrowser \--embedding

Your model's inference server listens at localhost:8080 by default.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

Octavia Butler was an American science fiction and fantasy writer who is best known for her groundbreaking work in the genre. She was born on August 26, 1947, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a family of educators. Her father, Dr. George Butler, was a professor of English at Temple University, while her mother, Dorothy Butler, was an elementary school teacher.
Octavia grew up in the city and attended public schools until she graduated from high school. She then went on to earn a bachelor's degree in English literature from Temple University and a master's degree in education from the University of Pennsylvania.
After graduating, Butler worked as an elementary school teacher for several years before pursuing her passion for writing full-time. She began publishing short stories in science fiction and fantasy magazines in the 1970s, and her work quickly gained recognition.
Her first novel, Kindred, was published in 1979 and became a bestseller. It was followed by several other novels that explored themes of race, gender, and science fiction. Butler's writing style was characterized by its vivid imagery, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes.
In addition to her writing, Butler also worked as an editor for various science fiction and fantasy magazines and served as a consultant on several television shows and films. She died in 2016 at the age of 67 due to complications from cancer.
What are some of Octavia Butler's most famous works?
Octavia Butler is best known for her groundbreaking work in the science fiction and fantasy genre, which includes several novels that explore themes of race, gender, and science fiction. Here are a few of her most famous works:
1. Kindred (1979) - This novel follows the story of Dana, a young African American woman who is transported back to the antebellum South in search of her ancestor, Rachel. The novel explores themes of race, identity, and family history.
2. Parable of the Sower (1980) - This novel follows the story of Lauren Olamina, a young woman who is living in a dystopian future where the government has destroyed most of society's infrastructure. The novel explores themes of survival, rebellion, and hope.
3. Freedom (1987) - This novel follows the story of Lena, a young woman who is forced to flee her home in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The novel explores themes of identity, family, and survival in a post-apocalyptic world.
4. The Butterfly War (1987) - This novel follows the story of two sisters, Lila and Maya, who are forced to flee their home in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The novel explores themes of identity, family, and survival in a post-apocalyptic world.
5. The Parasol Protectorate (1987) - This novel follows the story of Lila, a young woman who is recruited into a secret organization that fights against the oppressive government. The novel explores themes of resistance, loyalty, and sacrifice in a post-apocalyptic world.
6. Kindred: The Time-Traveler (1987) - This novella follows the story of Dana, who is transported back to the antebellum South in search of her ancestor, Rachel. The novella explores themes of family history and time travel in a post-apocalyptic world.
These are just a few examples of Octavia Butler's many works. Her writing style was characterized by its vivid imagery, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes.

**WARNING: TinyLlama's description of Octavia Butler above contains many falsehoods.** For example, she was born in California, not Pennsylvania. The information about her family and her education is a hallucation. She did not work as an elementary school teacher. Instead, she took a series of temporary jobs that would allow her to focus her energy on writing. Her work did not "quickly gain recognition": she sold her first short story around 1970, but did not gain prominence for another 14 years, when her short story "Speech Sounds" won the Hugo Award in 1984. Please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler) for a real biography of Octavia Butler.

We use the TinyLlama model in this example notebook primarily because it's small and therefore quick to download for example purposes. A larger model might hallucinate less. However, this should serve as a reminder that LLMs often do lie, even about topics that are well-known enough to have a Wikipedia page. It's important verify their outputs with your own research.
