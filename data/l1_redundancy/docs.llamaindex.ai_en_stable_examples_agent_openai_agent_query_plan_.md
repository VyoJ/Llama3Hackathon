OpenAI Agent Query Planning - LlamaIndex


In this demo, we explore adding a `QueryPlanTool` to an `OpenAIAgent`. This effectively enables the agent to do advanced query planning, all through a single tool!

The `QueryPlanTool` is designed to work well with the OpenAI Function API. The tool takes in a set of other tools as input. The tool function signature contains of a QueryPlan Pydantic object, which can in turn contain a DAG of QueryNode objects defining a compute graph. The agent is responsible for defining this graph through the function signature when calling the tool. The tool itself executes the DAG over any corresponding tools.

In this setting we use a familiar example: Uber 10Q filings in March, June, and September of 2022.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

Based on the provided context information, we can analyze Uber's revenue growth for the three-month periods ending in March, June, and September.

1. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, Uber's revenue was $6.854 billion.
2. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, Uber's revenue was $8.073 billion.
3. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, Uber's revenue was $8.343 billion.

To analyze the growth, we can compare the revenue figures for each period:

- From March to June, Uber's revenue increased by $1.219 billion ($8.073 billion - $6.854 billion), which represents a growth of approximately 17.8% (($1.219 billion / $6.854 billion) \* 100).
- From June to September, Uber's revenue increased by $0.270 billion ($8.343 billion - $8.073 billion), which represents a growth of approximately 3.3% (($0.270 billion / $8.073 billion) \* 100).

In summary, Uber experienced significant revenue growth of 17.8% between the three-month periods ending in March and June, followed by a smaller growth of 3.3% between the periods ending in June and September.
