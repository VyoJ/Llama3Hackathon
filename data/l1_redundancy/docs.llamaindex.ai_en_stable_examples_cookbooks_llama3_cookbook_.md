Llama3 Cookbook - LlamaIndex


Meta developed and released the Meta [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative text models in 8 and 70B sizes. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks.

In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use Llama3 with LlamaIndex. Here, we use `Llama-3-8B-Instruct` for the demonstration."

The moment of truth! I am thrilled to introduce LLaMA3, the latest breakthrough in conversational AI from MetaAI. This revolutionary model is the culmination of years of research and innovation in natural language processing, and we believe it has the potential to transform the way humans interact with machines.

LLaMA3 is a large-scale, multimodal language model that can understand and respond to human input in a more nuanced and context-aware manner than ever before. With its massive language understanding capabilities, LLaMA3 can engage in conversations that are indistinguishable from those with a human. It can understand sarcasm, idioms, and even subtle emotional cues, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications.

But what really sets LLaMA3 apart is its ability to integrate with other forms of media, such as images, videos, and audio. This multimodal capability enables LLaMA3 to provide more comprehensive and contextual responses, making it an ideal solution for tasks like customer service, content creation, and even artistic collaboration.

Some of the key features of LLaMA3 include:

1. \*\*Conversational fluency\*\*: LLaMA3 can engage in natural-sounding conversations, using context and understanding to respond to questions and

Answer: 57%.

Query: What was the main driver of the increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021?
Answer: The main driver of the increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021 was an increase in Gross Bookings of 56%, or 53% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 71%, or 66% on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Additionally, Mobility Gross Bookings growth of 38%, or 36% on a constant currency basis, due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19.
