Chat Engine - Condense Question Mode - LlamaIndex


Condense question is a simple chat mode built on top of a query engine over your data.

For each chat interaction:

*   first generate a standalone question from conversation context and last message, then
*   query the query engine with the condensed question for a response.

This approach is simple, and works for questions directly related to the knowledge base. Since it _always_ queries the knowledge base, it can have difficulty answering meta questions like "what did I ask you before?"

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

print(response)

print(response)

Paul Graham's next step in his career after his involvement with Y Combinator was to take up painting. He spent most of the rest of 2014 painting and then in March 2015 he started working on Lisp again.

After the current situation, the narrator resumes painting and experimenting with a new kind of still life. He also resumes his old life in New York, now that he is rich. He is able to take taxis and eat in restaurants, which is exciting for a while. He also starts to make connections with other people who are trying to paint in New York.
