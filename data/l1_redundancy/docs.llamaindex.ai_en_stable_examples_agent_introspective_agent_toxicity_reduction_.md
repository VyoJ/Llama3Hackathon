Introspective Agents: Performing Tasks With Reflection - LlamaIndex


**WARNING: this notebook contains content that may be considered offensive or sensitive to some.**

In this notebook, we cover how to use the `llama-index-agent-introspective` integration package to define an agent that performs tasks while utilizing the reflection agent pattern. We call such agents "Introspective Agents". These agents perform tasks by first generating an initial response to the task and then iteratively executing reflection and correction cycles on successive responses until a stopping condition has been met or a max number of iterations has been reached.

1 Toxicity Reduction: Problem Setup[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#1-toxicity-reduction-problem-setup)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this notebook, the task we'll have our introspective agents perform is "toxicity reduction". In particular, given a certain harmful text we'll ask the agent to produce a less harmful (or more safe) version of the original text. As mentioned before, our introspective agent will do this by performing reflection and correction cycles until reaching an adequately safe version of the toxic text.

2 Using `IntrospectiveAgents`[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#2-using-introspectiveagents)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 4: Title Image](https://d3ddy8balm3goa.cloudfront.net/llamaindex/introspective_agents.excalidraw.svg)

In this notebook, we'll build two introspective agents. Note that such `IntrospectiveAgents` delegate the task of reflection and correction to another agent, namely a `ReflectiveAgentWorker`. This reflective agent needs to be supplied to an introspective agent at construction time. Additionally, a `MainAgentWorker` can also be supplied, which is responsible for generating the initial response to the task — if none is supplied, then the user input is assumed to be the initial response to the task. For this notebook, we build the following `IntrospectiveAgent`'s:

a. `IntrospectiveAgent` that uses a `ToolInteractiveReflectionAgent`

b. `IntrospectiveAgent` that uses a `SelfReflectionAgent`

For the one that uses tool-interactive reflection, we'll use the Perspective API to get toxicity scores of our texts. This follows the example provided in the CRITIC paper.

### 2a `IntrospectiveAgent` that uses a `ToolInteractiveReflectionAgent`[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#2a-introspectiveagent-that-uses-a-toolinteractivereflectionagent)

The first thing we will do here is define the `PerspectiveTool`, which our `ToolInteractiveReflectionAgent` will make use of thru another agent, namely a `CritiqueAgent`.

To use Perspecive's API, you will need to do the following steps:

1.  Enable the Perspective API in your Google Cloud projects
2.  Generate a new set of credentials (i.e. API key) that you will need to either set an env var `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY` or supply directly in the appropriate parts of the code that follows.

To perform steps 1. and 2., you can follow the instructions outlined here: [https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-enable-the-api?language=en\_US](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-enable-the-api?language=en_US).

With the helper class in hand, we can define our tool by first defining a function and then making use of the `FunctionTool` abstraction.

#### Build `IntrospectiveAgent` & `ToolInteractiveReflectionAgent`[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#build-introspectiveagent-toolinteractivereflectionagent)

With our tool define, we can now build our `IntrospectiveAgent` and the required `ToolInteractiveReflectionAgentWorker`. To construct the latter, we need to also construct a `CritiqueAgentWorker` that will ultimately be responsible for performing the reflection with the tools.

The code provided below defines a helper function to construct this `IntrospectiveAgent`. This is done for convenience as we will later put the two reflection techniques to the test!

### 2b `IntrospectiveAgent` that uses a `SelfReflectionAgentWorker`[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#2b-introspectiveagent-that-uses-a-selfreflectionagentworker)

Similar to the previous subsection, now we will build an `IntrospectiveAgent` that uses `SelfReflectionAgentWorker`. This reflection technique doesn't make use of any tools, and instead only uses a supplied LLM to perform both reflection and correction. Moreover, we similarly define a helper function for building such an `IntrospectiveAgent` next.

The assistant needs to focus on creating a response that aligns with the goal of generating safer text versions without repeating the potentially toxic content provided by the user.'}
Correction: Discussing dietary choices, particularly veganism, often brings up strong opinions. It's important to approach these conversations with respect and understanding, recognizing that people choose their diets for a variety of reasons, including ethical concerns for animal welfare. It's crucial to avoid generalizations and acknowledge the diversity of experiences and beliefs within any group.

#### Toxicity Score (Out of Curiosity)[¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/introspective_agent_toxicity_reduction/#toxicity-score-out-of-curiosity)

Since this reflection technique doesn't make use of any tools, we may be curious to know the toxicity score of the final correction.

In this section of the notebook, we will run pass a handful or so of harmful texts to each of the two `IntrospectiveAgent`'s defined. These examples were sourced from the CRITIC paper as well as from the [Guardrails AI docs](https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs/examples/toxic_language).

Now lets have each of the agents process these harmful texts to create safer versions of them. We will note the toxicity score for each and conduct a quick analysis to compare the two reflection mechanisms. It probably goes without saying that this sample size is not nearly big enough to draw any statistically significant conclusions. With that being said, it does corroborate to a degree the results that were observed in the experiments of the CRITIC paper (as summarized in the PaperCard above).

As we can see, the `tool_interactive_reflection` method yields lower toxicity scores than `self_reflection` does. Also note that both do lead to drastic improvements over the original harmful text. This result is in agreement (again, ignoring statistical significance due to our small sample size) with the results observed in the CRITIC paper. Specifically, that reflection that uses appropriate external tools leads to better results than using LLMs alone to perform the reflection. As such, a sensible recommendation would be to use tool-interactive reflection whenever appropriate tools exist.
