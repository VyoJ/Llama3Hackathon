Markdown Content:
Multi-Document Agents - LlamaIndex


In this guide, you learn towards setting up an agent that can effectively answer different types of questions over a larger set of documents.

These questions include the following

*   QA over a specific doc
*   QA comparing different docs
*   Summaries over a specific doc
*   Comparing summaries between different docs

We do this with the following architecture:

*   setup a "document agent" over each Document: each doc agent can do QA/summarization within its doc
*   setup a top-level agent over this set of document agents. Do tool retrieval and then do CoT over the set of tools to answer a question.

Setup and Download Data[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/multi_document_agents/#setup-and-download-data)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll define imports and then download Wikipedia articles about different cities. Each article is stored separately.

We load in 18 cities - this is not quite at the level of "hundreds" of documents but its still large enough to warrant some top-level document retrieval!

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

Building Multi-Document Agents[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/multi_document_agents/#building-multi-document-agents)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section we show you how to construct the multi-document agent. We first build a document agent for each document, and then define the top-level parent agent with an object index.

### Build Document Agent for each Document[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/multi_document_agents/#build-document-agent-for-each-document)

In this section we define "document agents" for each document.

We define both a vector index (for semantic search) and summary index (for summarization) for each document. The two query engines are then converted into tools that are passed to an OpenAI function calling agent.

This document agent can dynamically choose to perform semantic search or summarization within a given document.

We create a separate document agent for each city.

### Build Retriever-Enabled OpenAI Agent[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/multi_document_agents/#build-retriever-enabled-openai-agent)

We build a top-level agent that can orchestrate across the different document agents to answer any user query.

This agent takes in all document agents as tools. This specific agent `RetrieverOpenAIAgent` performs tool retrieval before tool use (unlike a default agent that tries to put all tools in the prompt).

Here we use a top-k retriever, but we encourage you to customize the tool retriever method!

Got output: Beijing has a rich history that spans several dynasties. It was the capital of the Ming dynasty, during which the city took its current shape and many of its major attractions, such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, were constructed. The Qing dynasty succeeded the Ming dynasty and made Beijing its sole capital. During this time, the Imperial residence and the general layout of the city remained largely unchanged. However, the city faced challenges during the Second Opium War and the Boxer Rebellion, resulting in the looting and destruction of important structures. In the early 20th century, Beijing saw the signing of a peace agreement between the Eight-Nation Alliance and the Chinese government, which led to the restoration of Qing dynasty rule. However, the dynasty eventually collapsed in 1911.
