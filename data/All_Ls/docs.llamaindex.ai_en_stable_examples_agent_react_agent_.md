ReAct Agent - A Simple Intro with Calculator Tools - LlamaIndex


This is a notebook that showcases the ReAct agent over very simple calculator tools (no fancy RAG pipelines or API calls).

We show how it can reason step-by-step over different tools to achieve the end goal.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

Define Function Tools[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/react_agent/#define-function-tools)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We setup some trivial `multiply` and `add` tools. Note that you can define arbitrary functions and pass it to the `FunctionTool` (which will process the docstring and parameter signature).

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

def multiply(a: int, b: int) \-> int:
    """Multiply two integers and returns the result integer"""
    return a \* b

multiply\_tool \= FunctionTool.from\_defaults(fn\=multiply)

def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int: """Multiply two integers and returns the result integer""" return a \* b multiply\_tool = FunctionTool.from\_defaults(fn=multiply)

InÂ \[Â \]:

Copied!

def add(a: int, b: int) \-> int:
    """Add two integers and returns the result integer"""
    return a + b

add\_tool \= FunctionTool.from\_defaults(fn\=add)

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int: """Add two integers and returns the result integer""" return a + b add\_tool = FunctionTool.from\_defaults(fn=add)

Thought: I need to use the tools to help me answer the question. According to the order of operations in mathematics (BIDMAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be done before addition. So, I will first multiply 2 and 4, and then add the result to 2.
Action: multiply
Action Input: {'a': 2, 'b': 4}
Observation: 8
Thought: Now that I have the result of the multiplication, I need to add this result to 2.
Action: add

Observation: 10
Thought: I can answer without using any more tools.
Answer: 10

Value: 
You are designed to help with a variety of tasks, from answering questions     to providing summaries to other types of analyses.

## Tools
You have access to a wide variety of tools. You are responsible for using
the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate to complete the task at hand.
This may require breaking the task into subtasks and using different tools
to complete each subtask.

You have access to the following tools:
{tool\_desc}

## Output Format
To answer the question, please use the following format.

\`\`\`
Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: tool name (one of {tool\_names}) if using a tool.
Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num\_beams": 5}})
\`\`\`

Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.

Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num\_beams': 5}}.

If this format is used, the user will respond in the following format:

\`\`\`
Observation: tool response
\`\`\`

You should keep repeating the above format until you have enough information
to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond
in the one of the following two formats:

\`\`\`
Thought: I can answer without using any more tools.
Answer: \[your answer here\]
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
Thought: I cannot answer the question with the provided tools.
Answer: Sorry, I cannot answer your query.
\`\`\`

## Current Conversation
Below is the current conversation consisting of interleaving human and assistant messages.

### Customizing the Prompt[Â¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/react_agent/#customizing-the-prompt)

For fun, let's try instructing the agent to output the answer along with reasoning in bullet points. See "## Additional Rules" section.

InÂ \[Â \]:

Answer: Sorry, I cannot answer your query.
\`\`\`

\## Additional Rules
\- The answer MUST contain a sequence of bullet points that explain how you arrived at the answer. This can include aspects of the previous conversation history.
\- You MUST obey the function signature of each tool. Do NOT pass in no arguments if the function expects arguments.

Answer: The result of 5+3+2 is 10.

- I first added 5 and 3 using the add tool, which resulted in 8.
- Then I added the result (8) to 2 using the add tool again, which resulted in 10.
